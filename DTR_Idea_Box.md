# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation. 

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?

	**Hugh** My learning goals for this project are to increase my speed and adaptability with HTML and CSS, as well as to increase my proficiency and understanding with JQ/JS. I feel comfortable with Git/GitHub, but want to become more organized and regimented with my branches, commits, etc.
	
	**Brandon** I hope to further solidify my understanding of jQuery and JS to do common functions. Also to refine CSS to avoid duplicate code.

* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?

	**Hugh** I really like to attack the problem and get it down on paper and then brain storm with my partner. I'm very visual, so sketching out the page and pseudo coding work well for me. I do like to get into the zone with music and work independently, but I've learned the most when solving a problem with my partner, side-by-side, feeding off of one another’s knowledge.
	
	**Brandon** I find working together in-person to be beneficial because you can bounce ideas of each other, and you also get the benefit of knowing how the entire project works and the practice of creating it. However, sometimes divide and conquer is necessary.

* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?

	**Hugh** I communicate best in-person. I think it's easiest to gauge reaction/emotion that way. I do appreciate Slack as well because it's relatively immediate and allows people to share links, images, code, etc. when needing to work remotely. I appreciate honest feedback if it's for the betterment of the project. My partner shouldn't worry about stepping on my toes because if I'm doing something wrong or inefficiently, I want to know in order to better my habits.
	
	**Brandon** I am fine with communicating in person as well as over Slack. I am in favor of polite, direct communication to ensure everyone in the group is on the same page.

* How would you describe your work style?

	**Hugh** I sincerely enjoy working alone and getting it the flow of my work; I think this comes from being an artist and losing myself in what I'm doing. However, I also like forming close relationships and understand the importance of working with my peers. I think working alone allows me to really explore, but working with other people allows me to see things in a different light. A balance of both is best.
	
	**Brandon** It's important to me to be an equal contributor, and I will work to make sure everything gets done as needed. I like to have defined blocks of time for work instead of random, undefined work sessions.

* What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?

	**Hugh** I'm very organized which I think has helped the readability of my code. Everything (for the most part) is alphabetized and broken down into sections based on functionality. I'm also able to color match and work with spacing well, which aids in the general layout and color scheme of the website.
	
	**Brandon** My strengths are responsibility to ensure things get done and taking ownership of my work. I also like to have a clear organiational plan, which we both seem to have.

* What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?

	**Hugh** I think what went well in my last project was splitting up the workload. I don't think either of us felt like we were taking the lion's share. Each of us were able to collaborate and merge our ideas when needed. The only thing that went poorly was the initial division of work. We weren't really sure how to do this, so I did all of the initial HTML and CSS. This created a larger initial workload for me and left my partner in the dark as to what the id and class tags were for JS/JQ. However, I think Brandon and I have already surmounted this and will be able to work quicker and more efficiently because of it.
	
	**Brandon** The last project went very well. Our communication was strong, and both of us were willing to make time for pairings to receive help when we got stuck. The balance of work was also very equal.

* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?

	**Hugh** I think the best way for this is to meet together and collaborate on what the best course of action is. Together, our shared knowledge will point us toward the best solution to a particular problem.
	
	**Brandon** Communicate in person at class to decide the direction going forward. If decisions need to be made outside that, communicate on Slack.

* How will we overcome obstacles?

	**Hugh** Again, I think the best way to do this is through open communication. If either of us are struggling, it's important to feel able to approach one another in order to find a solution.
	
	**Brandon** Talk through them, be supportive of each other, reach out for help.

* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?

	**Hugh** I need a quiet space to work and do like to try and solve problems on my own. However, if the struggle becomes too much, I think it's important to reach out and get fresh eyes on the project.
	
	**Brandon** I like to work on things together, but sometimes I need a little time to recharge on my own. Sometimes going home helps to clear my head instead of staying in the building late into the night.

* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?

	**Hugh** I generally prefer working in the mornings and through lunch. I'm able to stay after class, but would like to leave no later than 6 PM. I'm then able to work independently at home later in the evening, but this time is limited if I stay later after class as I usually turn off around 10 PM.
	
	**Brandon** For this week I don't have any major scheduling constraints. I prefer to have an idea of when we're working with clear start and end points so you can plan around it.

* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?

	**Hugh** I do my best not to hold back on giving feedback, but do try to choose my words wisely. I may hold back periodically to make sure I'm seeing something from every angle in order to understand the situation better. Generally I like to give feedback in a conversational setting, allowing give and take from both parties.
	
	**Brandon** I like giving direct feedback. I try to give constructive feedback and like to think it out before giving it.

* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?

	**Hugh** My biggest strength technically is definitely being organized and aware of the little details that go into projects. I think this has shown in how my code is organized and my CSS overall. I think I need improvement with figuring out how various pieces of JQ/JS fit together, as well as how to refactor and make my code a little cleaner. I think my partner can help me learn best by showing me different ways to solve problems and to let me know if they've figured out a different way to do things.
	
	**Brandon** I feel fairly strong in CSS and the naming structure for the HTML. I feel I can understand the JS and JQ, but would like to improve on my ability to create them from scratch. I think this can be improved by working through those elements together.

* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?

	**Hugh** A steady use of Git and GitHub streamlines the project in my opinion. I think it makes it easy to collaborate and build the project, piece-by-piece, in an efficient and streamlined way. I also would like to dig into Waffle to break the project out visually and assign tasks to my partner and myself.
	
	**Brandon** Waffle, Slack, GitHub.

* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?

	**Hugh** Again, I think the best way to do this is to come together and brain storm. If we aren't able to solve it together, I think it's best to reach out to other cohorts or other resources at Turing.
	
	**Brandon** Reach out for help to each other, as well as outside resources. Communication about what's happening is key.

* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?

	**Hugh** I think the project is successful if the end result is something that both partners can speak for and be proud of. Regardless if we execute each and every requirement, I think the best thing is for both of us to feel satisfied and accomplished by the time the project is finished, having known we put everything we could into it.
	
	**Brandon** I think the project will be successful if we reach all key requirements, and both feel that we learned and improved.

* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

	**Hugh** Lots of high-fives, lots of 'Thank you's, and an appreciation for the work the other person has accomplished, especially in regards to how it has helped build up our own success.
	
	**Brandon** I think letting the other person know when you think they did good work is important. Get excited by the small wins, not just the big picture.
